# 🦠 COVID-19 Exploration Project  

## 📋 Overview  
This project explores global COVID-19 data to analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations. Using SQL, advanced queries were performed to uncover insights into fatality rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.  

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  
- **Database**: SQL Server  
- **Data Source**: [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)  
- **Skills**: Joins, Aggregate Functions, CTEs, Temp Tables, Views, Rolling Calculations, Converting Data types.

## 🔄 Process  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Downloaded data from Our World in Data and divided it into two Excel sheets:  
     - **COVID Deaths**  
     - **COVID Vaccinations**  
   - Imported the data into a SQL Server database named `PortfolioProjects`.  

2. **Data Exploration**:  
   - Analyzed key questions using SQL queries:  
     - 💡 Total cases vs. total deaths: Understanding fatality rates.  
     - 🌍 Infection rates by country and continent: Percent population infected.  
     - 📈 Vaccination progress: Rolling vaccinated people vs. total population.  

3. **Advanced SQL Techniques**:  
   - Created **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Temporary Tables** for complex calculations.  
   - Developed **views** to store data for visualizations and further analysis.
